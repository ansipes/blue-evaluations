It was very helpful to watch the process of how to make things in Xd or VS Code, and the opportunity to revisit the process through the recorded lectures made understanding what to do very easy. The only thing that was unclear to me was how participation was graded, and it wasn't clear that it would be so reliant on statistics. Also, it was very concerning that grades were only released within a week of classes ending, but the class had many opportunities to present projects which could help gauge my performance in class somewhat.",

The only negative is we didn't get a ton of feedback in terms of grades until the end of the semester would like to have seen my early project grades sooner to be able to see what I needed to improve on in later projects. Also, I thought the grading of participation was somewhat harsh, I contributed in class and on slack throughout the semester so it was a bit confusing to see a low grade for participation. I think anyone who contributes regularly should be getting an A in that category rather than on the sliding scale that was used. But otherwise, a great teacher who I would highly reccomend.",
