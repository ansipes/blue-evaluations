Andrew did a great job with lectures, and particularly with demonstrations, which were really helpful when I went to do my own coding. Andrew as also always super helpful. He was always available for help. whether that was through Zoom or Slack, and he also did a really good job of letting his students know when he would be available. He even made a final grade calculator for this specific class, which was insane to me because I have never had a teacher create a whole program/website to help their students like that. I would definitely recommend Andrew to anyone taking MEJO 187.",
