Andrew did a great job with lectures, and particularly with demonstrations, which were really helpful when I went to do my own coding. Andrew as also always super helpful. He was always available for help. whether that was through Zoom or Slack, and he also did a really good job of letting his students know when he would be available. He even made a final grade calculator for this specific class, which was insane to me because I have never had a teacher create a whole program/website to help their students like that.

The only thing that was unclear to me was how participation was graded, and it wasn't clear that it would be so reliant on statistics.

Also, I thought the grading of participation was somewhat harsh, I contributed in class and on slack throughout the semester so it was a bit confusing to see a low grade for participation. I think anyone who contributes regularly should be getting an A in that category rather than on the sliding scale that was used. But otherwise, a great teacher who I would highly reccomend.",

            "text": "Professor Sipes is the most patient professor I have ever worked with. No matter how many stupid questions students ask or how much help students need completing basic tasks, Professor Sipes is patient and willing to help students wherever they are at. While this is a quality that I really appreciate about Professor Sipes and is definitely a major strength, sometimes his patience slowed down the course of the class to help one student, making other students wait around. Perhaps this can be fixed by allowing students to work in pairs to solve simple problems rather than having the teacher help every student individually. Additionally, I think the class did a great job of showing students specific skills and how to accomplish specific tasks. However, I think that it could be improved upon by focusing on teaching problem solving skills. Often times I found myself getting stuck on a problem and not knowing how to move forward without further individual instruction from Professor Sipes. I think this could be improved upon if the class was slightly more focused on problem solving skills rather than specific examples. Lastly, as the semester progressed I found that Professor Sipes took the feedback students gave him to heart and improved his teaching methods!! By the end of the semester, the class was working on in class examples and then turning them in for a completion grade. While I think this was a good first step in having hands–on work, I think it needs to be expanded upon. Right now I felt like we were copying code while Professor Sipes walked through the problem. In the future I would suggest Professor Sipes walking through a problem with the class and explaining how to do something. Then providing students a very similar problem with one or two small twists to complete in class to turn in for the completion grade. I think this in itself will develop problem solving skills and allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the lesson while still being a manageable problem. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and thought that Professor Sipes did a great job! He was so nice and patient and wanted his students to succeed. I really appreciated all of his zoom office hours and the feedback he would willing give on projects! Professor Sipes truly invested in this class and his students!!",
