No matter how many stupid questions students ask or how much help students need completing basic tasks, Professor Sipes is patient and willing to help students wherever they are at. While this is a quality that I really appreciate about Professor Sipes and is definitely a major strength, <mark>sometimes his patience slowed down the course of the class to help one student, making other students wait around. Perhaps this can be fixed by allowing students to work in pairs to solve simple problems rather than having the teacher help every student individually.</mark> Additionally, I think the class did a great job of showing students specific skills and how to accomplish specific tasks. However, I think that it could be improved upon by focusing on teaching problem solving skills. <mark>Often times I found myself getting stuck on a problem and not knowing how to move forward without further individual instruction from Professor Sipes. I think this could be improved upon if the class was slightly more focused on problem solving skills rather than specific examples.</mark> Lastly, as the semester progressed I found that Professor Sipes took the feedback students gave him to heart and improved his teaching methods!! By the end of the semester, the class was working on in class examples and then turning them in for a completion grade. While I think this was a good first step in having hands–on work, I think it needs to be expanded upon. Right now I felt like we were copying code while Professor Sipes walked through the problem. In the future I would suggest Professor Sipes walking through a problem with the class and explaining how to do something. Then providing students a very similar problem with one or two small twists to complete in class to turn in for the completion grade. I think this in itself will develop problem solving skills and allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the lesson while still being a manageable problem. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and thought that Professor Sipes did a great job! He was so nice and patient and wanted his students to succeed. I really appreciated all of his zoom office hours and the feedback he would willing give on projects! Professor Sipes truly invested in this class and his students!!","tags":["positive","critical"],"response":"I have since made problem solving a big focus of the class, especially for the code portion.
